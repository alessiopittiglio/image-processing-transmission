# Exercise 2
Write a function in MATLAB called myimhist  that accepts a 256-level grayscale image as input and returns the vector h as output containing the histogram of the image levels. 

The array h must be ordered so that h(1) is the number of pixels with gray level 0, h(2) is the number of pixels with gray level 1, and in general h(n) number of pixels with gray level n-1, where n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 256.

Apply the function to the Berkeley.jpg image.
