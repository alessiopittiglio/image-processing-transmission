# Exercise 3

Write a MATLAB function that implements forward propagation of a fully-connected neural network trained with ReLU activation functions. For each fixed number of layers and neurons in each layer, the function must take as argument a real array of N components representing the input to the neural network, and must output a real array of
M components representing the output of the neural network.

In this exercise I decided to follow an [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/under-the-hood-of-neural-networks-part-1-fully-connected-5223b7f78528) that illustrated a simple network already trained. This is a simple neural network with 2-hidden layers which tries to classify a binary number (here decimal 3) as even or odd.
